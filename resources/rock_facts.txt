There are three different types of rock: Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic.
Geology is the study of the rocks.
The seafloor is formed of a dark lava called basalt.
Some granite, in Australia, is believed to be more than four billion years old.
Rocks are made of minerals.
Sandstone is formed from sand, mudstone from mud, and limestone from seashells, diatoms, or bonelike minerals precipitating out of calcium-rich water.
Sedimentary rock is very common.
Igneous rock comes from molten magma.
Metamorphic rock has been put under a lot of pressure and heat.
Metamorphic rocks are sedimentary or igneous rocks that have been transformed by pressure, heat, or the intrusion of fluids.
Marble is metamorphosed limestone, quartzite is metamorphosed sandstone, and gneiss, another common metamorphic rock, sometimes begins as granite.
A rock is a naturally occuring solid.
Rocks are generally made up of two of more minerals, mixed up through geological processes.
Gemstones are minerals valued by humans for their beauty, rarity, and durability. The most valuable include diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and sapphires.
Rocks are great!
Rock Pokémon usually have high defense - however, since many Rock Pokémon are part Ground they have a 4x weakness to both Grass and Water.
